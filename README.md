# Memory-Managment-Visualization
Project for OOD FALL 2018

Group: Nicholas La Sala, John Stranahan, Gene Zaleski, Youngyo Na, RJ Boucher, Craig Wert.

The project simulates process enter a memory stack, running to completion and exiting the memory.
Processes are allocated memory using first fit, and processes that are too large are placed in a queue to wait for more space to be made availble.
